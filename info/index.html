So colorful, so shrill and yet perfectly twisted, so dazzling and yet without a blender, a wild, fascinating, eccentric ride through a very own universe. [...] He has a shady tone, a prize melancholy, is gladly worked up. [...] So the Australian promotes a sound performance after another to the surface, the charms are well-received and never over the top. [...] The magic is based on the distancing unit, of the delicacy of the apparent urgent artificiality." </i>- <a href="http://dasklienicum.blogspot.com.au/2016/10/neue-tone-1677-gregor.html">das klienicum</a></font></p></center>
