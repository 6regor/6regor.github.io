        <center><div><font size="4" face="times">These are things that I've found. I started documenting them on 1/3/17 but some were found well before this. My grandpa finds so many things, from several dollars a day, to mobile phones, computer keyboards, to packaged food and drink items, watches, cigarettes, gardening tools, and many more. He walks a lot with his hands behind his back and his eyes scanning the ground. Often when he sees something resembling a coin, he kicks it first with his foot to make sure before bending down to pick it up.</font></div></center>
        <center><div><font size="3" face="times">If you see any item belonging to you, email me at <b>gregorkompar@gmail.com</b> and I will gladly re-unite you with it, unless I am particularly fond of it, in which case I will offer you a trade, and if you decline, I will block you from contacting me further.</font></div></center>
